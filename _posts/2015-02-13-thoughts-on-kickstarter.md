Yesterday, I received an email update telling me that my [Sense](https://hello.is) was finally going to ship, first to its Kickstarter backers and then to preorders. Two weeks ago, my preorder of the very popular [Canary](http://canary.is) arrived. First, we'll go through an overview about what they were and why I backed them. 

The Sense is a nifty little sphere that tracks a user's sleep quality based on a number of factors (ambient light and noise, tossing and turning, heart rate mapping, etc.) that it gets from the environment and from a little tracker attached to the user's pillow. I backed it while the fundraising period was underway during the summer of 2014 because it was getting a lot of media coverage and seemed well designed. Also, I was hoping that it would help me get into the whole quantitative body movement/fad.

The Canary I pre-ordered after its funding period was over. It's notable for being one of the largest crowdsourced gadgets to date, gathering over $2 million and accruing backing from some prestigious venture capitalists. It acts as an all-in-one smart home security device, with a fisheye camera and an array of sensors that detect temperature, humidity, and a host of other things about its surroundings. Then, it learns over time and connects to the user's phone to notify them in case anything seems out of place. I bought two Canaries, one because I thought it would make a cool gift, and one because I wanted to try it out as an early adopter. 

Now that we're up to speed on what I spent my money on, let's talk about some timelines and discuss the pros and cons of crowdfunding. The Canary was fully backed on [Indiegogo](http://indiegogo.com) by August 26rd, 2013, total $2 million from the crowd and then another $10 million from VCs. Its timeline stated that all of the necessary research and planning had been completed and that a prototype had been made. The manufacturers would be lined up in March 2014 and production would begin around June or July, with backers receiving their Canaries by August and retail beginning later in the year.
