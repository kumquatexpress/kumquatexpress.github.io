3:15am - Wake up for 6am flight, since Air Canada says to be there 2 hours early.

3:30am - Had a Dove milk chocolate square (1).

3:51am - Boarded taxi to airport, called by hotel guest services to arrive at 3:45.

3:54am - Taxi driver stares at phone while doing 70 on a curved on-ramp to the freeway.

3:58am - Driver decides now would be a good time to moisturize hands, does so using lotion held in glove compartment. Driver is rubbing hands together while driving with knees.

4:00am - We have hit 95 miles an hour. Still driving with knees. Lanes don't exist this early in the morning.

4:03am - Arrived at airport. Not sure why we tipped, perhaps for speed?

4:20am - Luggage checked in, heading to security checkpoint, not qualified for TSA precheck. Sadface.

4:50am - Sitting at the gate, waiting for boarding to begin. Freely browsing the internet for what may be the last time in a while.
