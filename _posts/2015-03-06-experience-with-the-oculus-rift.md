summary: What I noticed when playing with the Oculus Rift for the first time.

Earlier this month, I finally had the chance to use a [DK2](http://oculus.facebook.com), the second development version of the Oculus Rift, as part of a project involving virtual reality and computer vision. Immediately, I downloaded [Virtual Desktop](http://virtualdesktop.io) and [Vireio]() and tried out the platform both as a screen for daily use and as a new form of gaming immersion. 

Unfortunately for me, no matter how much I tweaked with the settings, I just couldn't get rid of the screen door effect of the display. This was especially pronounced when I viewed my own desktop/browser and tried to read text. Granted, the Oculus Rift isn't supposed to support text very well, and I doubt that we'll have developers putting on headsets in order to type in the near future. However, I noticed the same screen door effect while playing games that have been touted to work with OVR (Skyrim and Elite: Dangerous). It's not a deal-breaker by any means, but it definitely leads me to believe that the 1080p display in the current Oculus iteration is not going to be good enough for immersive realism. Crystal Cove, the consumer release of the Oculus rumored to be coming early next year, is supposed to have a 2500x1440 display, which should help matters. The visibility of individual pixels hampered my experience with the Rift, and it didn't quite live up to my expectations as a plug and play platform.

On the bright side, having the stereoscopic 3D effect of a screen that lives inches from your face is definitely a different feeling than using a normal monitor as a display. Everything looked more realistic, and the feeling of being encapsulated in a game without any interference from the outside world was liberating. One thing the DK2 deals with admirably well is in tracking translational motion of the user's head. In the first developer release version, some kinks weren't accounted for, such as lateral head motion, which wouldn't be detected by the device at all. The DK2's head tracking is accomplished with the help of a small infrared camera that can be clipped onto a monitor ala webcam. With this camera and its built-in accelerometer, it calculates the direction the user is facing and automatically adjusts the rendered scene to match, with very little extra code required from the developer side.
