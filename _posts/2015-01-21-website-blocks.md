summary: A dicussion of the different iterations my website has gone through.

In the very beginning, around 2011, I didn't have a website at all. This was freshman year in college, and I didn't really feel out of place, since the majority of people around me also didn't have one. After recruiting fairs during the year, I started concentrating on improving my online presence and portfolio recognition. I went on LinkedIn and added anyone whose name I recognized. I fleshed out my Facebook with things that defined "me". I put my resume up on Dropbox. I told myself I was doing all of these things just in case I would need them at some point in the future, but mostly it in order to feel like I was doing anything at all productive.

The last step towards creating my personal brand was setting up a website. I'd taken the basic computer science courses but had never really done much with web at this point. As such, setting up a domain, getting myself a server to host on, and finally building the site itself were all difficult tasks. During the summer of 2012, I set aside a block of four days to figure everything out. I had done web development only with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) before this and didn't quite understand the difference between a static webpage and a webapp, so my first intention was to set up a webapp because, well, I needed a server to serve my pages. I realized halfway through that setting up Rails wasn't necessary for such a simple project and decided to use one of the many CMS frameworks instead. Thus, the first iteration of the website was done with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), a full-fledged blogging platform whose capabilities I never even used. My main reason for using Drupal was that I'd found an easy way to set it up on one of the [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) free tier servers. I didn't understand what it was a server did or the client server relationship at all, so in my mind Drupal was a way to make my website viewable publically.

I left this website with its cheesy headline and 90's design up until I had time to rewrite the next iteration a full year in the future.
